# PlayTime
PlayTime contains multiple textbased games that can be played on the Java platform. This was made for an ICSE Year 10 project.

Minesweeper - Randomly generated mines on a 5x5 grid. The user can enter the coordinates of the place he wants to uncover. If it is a 0, then all the blocks around it are checked and like in the real game, all the boxes with 0 are opened with that one block. In the future, if worked on, I would like to put the abiliity to drop placeholders, and have a resizeable grid and changeable number of mines. The minesweeper grid was made by printing text in a way that it would look like a grid that the users would understand better. 

SnakesAndLadders - This is a conventional game of Snakes and Ladders where either 2 players or 1 player and 1 computer can play against each other. The computers dice is randomised. A 2 dimensional array is used to depict the grid and specific integers are used to show the snakes and the ladders. They're then printed such that the user can easily undersatand where the snakes and all are. More than 2 players to be able to play would be an improvement. 

TextRacer - A typing speed calculator that displays words ordered randomly that the user would have to type in. It shows the next word that would have to be entered too. After a one minute time limit passes, the number of words the user was able to type in correctly would be his typing speed in words per minute.
